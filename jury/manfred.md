Docker Hackaton, 15-dec-2014
============================

Topics :

- **Novelty**: Has anyone ever done this using Docker before?
- **Fit**: Does Docker improve the project or fundamentally enable enable it?
- **Efficiency**: Is this implementation small in size, easy to transport, quick to start up and run? Higher scores for more functionality in smaller images and faster start times.
- **Integration**: Does the project fit well into other systems, or is it sufficiently complex itself to be its own system? More (useful) interconnection gets more points.
- **Transparency**: Can other people easily recreate your project now that you've shown how? Is your code open source?
- **Presentation**: How well did you present your project? Did you speak clearly, cover all the important points, and generally impress people?
- **Usefulness**: Popular vote on how many would use each of the tied porjects. So keep your audience in mind!
- **Longevity**: Can the project be improved / built upon ?
